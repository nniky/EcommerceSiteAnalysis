# Ecommerce Site Analysis
I assume the position of an Ecommerce database analyst and explore a dataset from an online retailer who has just launched its first product.
Through various SQL queries I access and explore the database, perform mission critical analyses and analyze and optimize the businessâ€™ marketing channels, website, and product portfolio.

The database consists of six related tables which contain ecommerce data about website activity, products, orders and refunds.

## Analysis

My analysis comprises of a series of sql queries to explore
 1. top website pages
 2. bounce rates
 3. analysing a/b tests
 4. analysing the conversion funnel
 5. analysing websitetraffic
 6. analysing channel portfolio management
 7. analysing business patterns and seasonality
 8. product analysis 
 9. user analysis etc

The file `EcommerceSite_Advancedquerying.sql` houses the all SQL queries used in the analysis. In the file, I have specifically outlined what each query is attempting to explore using either an inline or block comment.
